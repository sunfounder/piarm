**No protective board?**

It is recommended to use a battery without a protection plate to maximize the performance of the module, and the on-board overcharge and over-discharge protection can be used without worrying about battery damage. If you use a battery with a protection plate may cause the output power does not reach the nominal 5V/3A. 

**Battery capacity?**
