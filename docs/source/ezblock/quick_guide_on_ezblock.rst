Quick Guide on Ezblock
===========================

There are 2 parts here:

* :ref:`ezb_servo_adjust` allows you to keep all the servos at 0 degrees to complete a proper and safe assembly (otherwise you will probably damage the servos).
* :ref:`install_ezblock` will guide you to download Ezblock Studio to play with your robot.

.. _ezb_servo_adjust:

Servo Adjust
--------------------------------

When assembling to the part with the servo, you need to keep the servo at 0° and secure it with the servo screw. Please follow the tutorial below to do this.


#. Firstly, :ref:`ezblock:install_ezblock_os_latest` onto a Micro SD card, once the installation is complete, insert it into the Raspberry Pi.

#. To ensure that the servo has been properly set to 0°, first insert the rocker arm into the servo shaft and then gently rotate the rocker arm to a different angle.

#. Follow the instructions on the assembly foldout, insert the battery holder cable and turn the power switch to the ON. Wait for 1-2 minutes, there will be a sound to indicate that the Raspberry Pi boots successfully.

#. Next, plug the servo cable into the P11 port as follows.

#. At this point you will see the servo arm rotate to a specific position (0°). If the servo arm does not return to 0°, press the RST button to restart the Robot HAT.

#. Now you can continue the installation as instructed on the assembly foldout.

.. note::

    * Do not unplug this servo cable before fastening this servo with the servo screw, you can unplug it after fastening.
    * Do not turn the servo while it is powered on to avoid damage; if the servo shaft is inserted at the wrong angle, pull out the servo and reinsert it.
    * Before assembling each servo, you need to plug the servo cable into P11 and turn on the power to set its angle to 0°.
    * This zeroing function will be disabled if you download a program to the robot later with the EzBlock APP.
